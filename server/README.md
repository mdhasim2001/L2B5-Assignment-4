API is an application programming interface that helps an application connect to another application and exchange data from a database.


How does the API work? Its description is given below.

1. A request comes from a client that I want to delete a piece of data, then the request from that client will come to the server through the API, then when the server understands that I have to delete this data, it will delete the data from the database and send a response to the client.

2. Through API, data can be exchanged according to the client's request. Through API, data can be updated from the database and filtered according to the client's requirements, and various data can be brought to the client from the database through the server.


So it can be said that API works like a bridge, just like you have to use a boat or bridge to cross a river. Similarly, through API, the client can make a request and fetch the desired data from the database through the server.
